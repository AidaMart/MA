This repository is dedicated to the homework submissions for the Marketing Analytics course.

Homework 1: Bass Model - Estimating Market Entry Activities

Overview:
The goal of Homework 1 is to explore the application of the Bass Model in estimating market entry activities. The Bass Model is a powerful technique used to assess the potential market and the number of adopters for a new product over time. It becomes particularly valuable when financial resources for market exploration are limited.

Key Steps:

Choosing New Innovation: In this assignment, you will start by selecting a new innovation or product that you wish to analyze.
Finding Look-Alike Products: Next, you'll identify similar products or innovations from the past to establish a foundation for your analysis.
Estimating Innovation and Imitation Rates (p, q): Estimating the parameters p and q of the Bass Model is a crucial step in understanding market dynamics.
Implementation and Explanation: Throughout the assignment, you will dive into each part, providing clear visualizations and comprehensive explanations of the steps and results.
The Bass Model is an essential tool in marketing analytics, and this assignment will help you gain practical experience in using it effectively.

Homework 2: A/B Testing

Overview:
Homework 2 focuses on A/B testing, a fundamental technique for evaluating the impact of changes to a website, app, or other user experiences. A/B testing allows you to assess the performance of two versions (A and B) and determine which one is more effective in achieving your objectives.


This assignment will provide you with hands-on experience in designing and conducting A/B tests, and interpreting the results to make data-driven decisions. Here two main algorithms are implemented: Epsilon Greedy and Thompson Sampling.
