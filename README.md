# Marketing-Analytics-Fall-2023-course-Homework Repository

This repository is dedicated to the homework submissions for the Marketing Analytics course. Below, you can find descriptions of each homework. Besides the general explanations, you can find each assignment's full requirements in the corresponding folder.

Homework 1: Bass Model 

Overview:
The goal of Homework 1 is to explore the application of the Bass Model in estimating market entry activities. The Bass Model is a powerful technique used to assess the potential market and the number of adopters for a new product over time. It becomes particularly valuable when financial resources for market exploration are limited.

Key Steps:

Choosing New Innovation: In this assignment, you will start by selecting a new innovation or product that you wish to analyze.
Finding Look-Alike Products: Next, you'll identify similar products or innovations from the past to establish a foundation for your analysis.
Estimating Innovation and Imitation Rates (p, q): Estimating the parameters p and q of the Bass Model is a crucial step in understanding market dynamics.
Implementation and Explanation: Throughout the assignment, you will dive into each part, providing clear visualizations and comprehensive explanations of the steps and results.
The Bass Model is an essential tool in marketing analytics, and this assignment will help you gain practical experience in using it effectively.

Homework 2: A/B Testing

Overview:
Homework 2 focuses on A/B testing, a fundamental technique for evaluating the impact of changes to a website, app, or other user experiences. A/B testing allows you to assess the performance of two versions (A and B) and determine which one is more effective in achieving your objectives.

Key Steps:

In Homework 2, you'll study A/B testing using Epsilon Greedy and Thompson Sampling algorithms. Your task is to design an experiment comparing the performance of four advertisement options represented as "bandits." A Bandit class has been provided as a foundation, with specific requirements to maintain. You must create EpsilonGreedy() and ThompsonSampling() classes and methods inherited from the Bandit() class. For Epsilon Greedy, you'll implement epsilon decay and design the experiment, while Thompson Sampling will be designed with known precision. The report should include visualizations of the learning process for each algorithm, cumulative rewards, storage of rewards in a CSV file with Bandit, Reward, and Algorithm details, as well as the printing of cumulative rewards and regret. This homework offers hands-on experience with bandit algorithms and A/B testing, providing valuable insights into their practical applications.
